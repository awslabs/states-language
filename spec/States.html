  <div id='structure'>
    <h2 id='structure'>Structure of a State Machine</h2>
    <p>A State Machine is represented by a
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-4">JSON
        Object</a>.</p>
    <h3 id='example'>Example: Hello World</h3>
    <p>The operation of a state machine is specified by states, which are
      represented by JSON objects, fields in the top-level "States" object.
      In this example, there is one state named "Hello World".</p>
    <pre><code class="statemachine">{
    "Comment": "A simple minimal example of the States language",
    "StartAt": "Hello World",
    "States": {
    "Hello World": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>When this state machine is launched, the interpreter begins
      execution by
      identifying the Start State. It executes that state, and then checks to
      see if the state is marked as an End State. If it is, the machine
      terminates and returns a result. If the state is not an End State, the
      interpreter looks for a "Next" field to determine what state to run
      next; it repeats this process until it reaches a
      <a href="#terminal-state">Terminal State</a> (Succeed,
      Fail, or an End State) or a runtime error occurs.</p>
    <p>In this example, the machine contains a single state
      named "Hello World".
      Because "Hello World" is a Task State, the interpreter
      tries to execute it. Examining the value of the "Resource" field shows
      that it points to a Lambda function, so the interpreter attempts
      to invoke that function. Assuming the Lambda function executes
      successfully, the machine will terminate successfully.</p>
    <p>A State Machine is represented by a JSON object.</p>
    <h3 id='toplevelfields'>Top-level fields</h3>
    <p>A State Machine MUST have an object field named "States",
      whose fields represent the states.</p>
    <p>A State Machine MUST have a string field named "StartAt", whose value
      MUST exactly match one of names of the "States" fields. The
      interpreter starts running the the machine at the named
      state.</p>
    <p>A State Machine MAY have
      a string field named "Comment",
      provided for human-readable description of the
      machine.</p>
    <p>A State Machine MAY have a string field named "Version", which gives
      the version of the States language used in the machine. This document
      describes version 1.0, and if omitted, the default value of "Version"
      is the string "1.0".</p>
    <p>A State Machine MAY have an integer field named "TimeoutSeconds".
      If provided, it provides the maximum number of seconds
      the machine is allowed to run.
      If the machine runs longer than the specified
      time, then the interpreter fails the machine with
      a <code class="nocheck">States.Timeout</code>
      <a href='#error-names'>Error Name</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id='body'>
    <h2 id='concepts'>Concepts</h2>
    <h3 id='states-fields'>States</h3>
    <p>States are represented as fields of the top-level "States" object.
      The state name, whose length MUST BE less than or equal to 128
      Unicode characters, is the field name; state
      names MUST be unique within the scope of the whole state machine.
      States describe tasks (units of work), or specify flow control
      (e.g. Choice).</p>
    <p>Here is an example state that executes a Lambda function:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"HelloWorld": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
  "Next": "NextState",
  "Comment": "Executes the HelloWorld Lambda function"
}</code></pre>
    <p>Note that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>All states MUST have a "Type" field. This document refers to the
          values of this field as a state’s <em>type</em>, and to a
          state such as the one in the example above as a Task
          State.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any state MAY have a "Comment" field, to hold a human-readable
          comment or description.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Most state types require additional fields as specified in
          this document. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p id='terminal-state'>Any state except for Choice, Succeed, and
          Fail MAY have a field
          named "End" whose value MUST be a boolean. The term "Terminal
          State" means a state with
          with <code class="nocheck">{ "End": true }</code>, or a state with
          <code class="nocheck">{ "Type": "Succeed" }</code>, or a state with
          <code class="nocheck">{ "Type": "Fail" }</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id='transition'>Transitions</h3>
    <p>Transitions link states together, defining the control flow for the
      state machine. After executing a non-terminal state, the interpreter
      follows a transition to the next state. For most state types,
      transitions are unconditional and specified through the state's
      "Next" field.</p>
    <p>All non-terminal states MUST have a "Next" field, except for the
      Choice State. The value of the "Next" field MUST exactly and
      case-sensitively match the name of the another state.</p>
    <p>States can have multiple incoming transitions from other states.</p>
    <h3 id='timestamps'>Timestamps</h3>
    <p>The Choice and Wait States deal with JSON field values which
      represent timestamps. These are strings which MUST conform to the
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt">RFC3339</a> profile of
      ISO 8601, with the further restrictions that an uppercase "T"
      character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase
      "Z" character MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone
      offset, for example "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z".</p>
    <h3 id='data'>Data</h3>
    <p>The interpreter passes data between states to perform calculations or
      to dynamically control the state machine’s flow. All such data MUST
      be expressed in JSON.</p>
    <p>When a state machine is started, the caller can provide an initial
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-2">JSON
        text</a> as input, which is passed to the machine's start state as
      input. If no input is provided, the default is an empty JSON
      object, <code>{}</code>.
      As each state is executed, it receives a
      JSON text as input and can produce arbitrary output, which MUST
      be a JSON text.
      When two states are linked by a transition, the
      output from the first state is passed as input to the second state. The
      output from the machine's terminal state is treated as its
      output. </p>
    <p>For example, consider a simple state machine that adds two numbers
      together:</p>
    <pre><code class="statemachine">{
  "StartAt": "Add",
  "States": {
    "Add": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:Add",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose the "Add" Lambda function is defined as:</p>
    <pre><code class="nocheck">exports.handler = function(event, context) {
  context.succeed(event.val1 + event.val2);
};</code></pre>
    <p>Then if this state machine was started with the input
      <code class="json">{ "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }</code>,
      then the output would be the JSON text consisting of the
      number <code class="nocheck">7</code>.</p>
    <p>The usual constraints applying to JSON-encoded data apply. In
      particular, note that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Numbers in JSON generally conform to JavaScript semantics,
          typically corresponding to double-precision IEEE-854
          values. For this and other interoperability concerns, see
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259">RFC 8259</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Standalone &quot;-delimited strings, booleans, and numbers are
          valid JSON texts.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id='context-object'>The Context Object</h3>
    <p>The interpreter can provide information to an executing state machine
      about the execution and other implementation details. This is delivered
      in the form of a JSON object called the "Context Object". This version
      of the States Language specification does not specify any contents of
      the Context Object.</p>

    <h3 id='path'>Paths</h3>
    <p>A Path is a string, beginning with "$", used to identify
      components with a JSON text.
      The syntax is that
      of <a href="https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath">JsonPath</a>.</p>
    <p>When a Path begins with "$$", two dollar signs, this signals that it is
      intended to identify content within the Context Object. The first dollar
      sign is stripped, and the remaining text, which begins with a dollar sign,
      is interpreted as the JSONPath applying to the Context Object.</p>
    <h3 id='ref-paths'>Reference Paths</h3>
    <p>A Reference Path is a Path with syntax limited in such a way that it
      can only identify a single node in a JSON structure: The operators
      "@", ",", ":", and "?" are not supported - all Reference Paths
      MUST be unambiguous references to a single value, array, or object
      (subtree).</p>
    <p>For example, if state input data contained the values:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
    "foo": 123,
    "bar": ["a", "b", "c"],
    "car": {
        "cdr": true
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Then the following Reference Paths would return:</p>
    <pre><code class="nocheck">$.foo => 123
$.bar => ["a", "b", "c"]
$.car.cdr => true</code></pre>
    <p>Paths and Reference Paths are used by certain states, as specified
      later in this document, to control the flow of a state machine or to
      configure a state's settings or
      options.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of acceptable Reference Path syntax:</p>
    <pre><code class="nocheck">$.store.book
$.store\.book
$.\stor\e.boo\k
$.store.book.title
$.foo.\.bar
$.foo\@bar.baz\[\[.\?pretty
$.&amp;Ж中.\uD800\uDF46
$.ledgers.branch[0].pending.count
$.ledgers.branch[0]
$.ledgers[0][22][315].foo
$['store']['book']
$['store'][0]['book']</code></pre>

    <h3 id='payload-template'>Payload Template</h3>
    <p>A state machine interpreter dispatches data as input to tasks to do useful
      work, and receives output back from them. It is frequently desired to
      reshape input data to meet the format expectations of tasks, and
      similarly to reshape the output coming back. A JSON
      object structure called a Payload Template is provided for this purpose.</p>
    <p>In the Task, Map, Parallel, and Pass States, the Payload Template is the value
      of a field named "Parameters". In the Task, Map, and Parallel States, there is another
      Payload Template which is the value of a field named "ResultSelector".</p>
    <p>A Payload Template MUST be a JSON object; it has no required fields.
      The interpreter processes the Payload Template as described in this
      section; the result of that processing is called the payload.</p>
    <p>To illustrate by example, the Task State has a field named "Parameters"
      whose value is a Payload Template. Consider the following Task State:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "first": 88,
    "second": 99
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this case, the payload is the object with "first" and "second" fields
      whose values are respectively 88 and 99. No processing needs to be performed and the
      payload is identical to the Payload Template.</p>
    <p>Values from the Payload Template’s input and the Context Object can be
      inserted into the payload with a combination of a
      field-naming convention, Paths and Intrinsic Functions.</p>
    <p>If any field within the Payload Template (however deeply nested) has a name ending with the characters ".$",
      its value is transformed according to rules below and the field is renamed to strip the ".$" suffix.</p>
    <p>If the field value begins with only one "$", the value MUST be a Path. In this case,
      the Path is applied to the Payload Template’s input and is the new field value.</p>
    <p>If the field value begins with "$$", the first dollar sign is stripped and the remainder MUST be a Path.
      In this case, the Path is applied to the Context Object and is the new field value.</p>
    <p>If the field value does not begin with "$", it MUST be an Intrinsic Function (see below).
      The interpreter invokes the Intrinsic Function and the result is the new field value.</p>
    <p>If the path is legal but cannot be applied successfully, the interpreter fails the machine execution with an Error Name of "States.ParameterPathFailure". If the Intrinsic Function fails during evaluation,
      the interpreter fails the machine execution with an Error Name of "States.IntrinsicFailure".</p>
    <p>A JSON object MUST NOT have duplicate field names after fields ending with the characters ".$" are renamed to strip the ".$" suffix.</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "flagged": true,
    "parts": {
      "first.$": "$.vals[0]",
      "last3.$": "$.vals[3:]"
    },
    "weekday.$": "$$.DayOfWeek",
    "formattedOutput.$": "States.Format('Today is {}', $$.DayOfWeek)"
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose that the input to the P is as follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="json">{
  "flagged": 7,
  "vals": [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
}</code></pre>
    <p>Further, suppose that the Context Object is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "DayOfWeek": "TUESDAY"
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this case, the effective input to the code identified in
      the "Resource" field would be as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "flagged": true,
  "parts": {
    "first": 0,
    "last3": [30, 40, 50]
  },
  "weekday": "TUESDAY",
  "formattedOutput": "Today is TUESDAY"
}</code></pre>

    <h3 id='intrinsic-functions'>Intrinsic Functions</h3>
    <p>The States Language provides a small number of "Intrinsic Functions", constructs
      which look like functions in programming languages and can be used to
      help Payload Templates process the data going to and from Task
      Resources. See <a href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a> for a full list of Intrinsic Functions</p>
    <p>Here is an example of an an Intrinsic Function named "States.Format" being used
      to prepare data:</p>
    <pre><code class='state'>"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "greeting.$": "States.Format('Welcome to {} {}\\'s playlist.', $.firstName, $.lastName)"
  }
}</code></pre>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>An Intrinsic Function MUST be a string.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Intrinsic Function MUST begin with an Intrinsic Function name. An Intrinsic Function name MUST contain
          only the characters A through Z, a through z, 0 through 9, ".", and
          "_".</p>
        <p>All Intrinsic Functions defined by this specification have names that begin
          with "States.". Other implementations may define their own
          Intrinsic Functions whose names MUST NOT begin with "States.".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Intrinsic Function name MUST be followed immediately by a list of zero
          or more arguments, enclosed by "(" and ")", and separated by
          commas.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Intrinsic Function arguments may be strings enclosed by apostrophe
          (<code>'</code>)
          characters, numbers, null, Paths, or nested Intrinsic Functions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of a string, number or null argument is the argument itself.
          The value of an argument which is a Path is the result of applying it to the input of the Payload Template.
          The value of an argument which is an Intrinsic Function is the result of the function invocation."</p>
        <p>Note that in the example above, the first argument
          of <code>States.Format</code> could have been a Path that yielded the
          formatting template string.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The following characters are reserved for all Intrinsic Functions and MUST be escaped: ' { } \</p>
        <p>If any of the reserved characters needs to appear as part of the value
          without serving as a reserved character, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.</p>
        <p>If the character "\" needs to appear as part of the value
          without serving as an escape character, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.</p>
        <p>
          The literal string <code>\'</code> represents <code>'</code>.<br/>
          The literal string <code>\{</code> represents <code>{</code>.<br/>
          The literal string <code>\}</code> represents <code>}</code>.<br/>
          The literal string <code>\\</code> represents <code>\</code>.
        </p>

        <p>In JSON, all backslashes contained in a string literal value must be escaped with another backslash, therefore, the above will equate to:</p>

        <p>
          The escaped string <code>\\'</code> represents <code>'</code>.<br/>
          The escaped string <code>\\{</code> represents <code>{</code>.<br/>
          The escaped string <code>\\}</code> represents <code>}</code>.<br/>
          The escaped string <code>\\\\</code> represents <code>\</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If an open escape backslash <code>\</code> is found in the Intrinsic Function, the interpreter will throw a runtime error.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id='filters'>Input and Output Processing</h3>
    <p>As described above, data is passed between states as JSON texts.
      However, a state may want to process only a subset of its input data,
      and may want that data structured differently from the way it appears
      in the input. Similarly, it may want to control the format and
      content of the data that it passes on as output.</p>
    <p>Fields named "InputPath", "Parameters", "ResultSelector", "ResultPath", and "OutputPath" exist to support this.</p>
    <p>Any state except for the Fail and Succeed States MAY have "InputPath" and "OutputPath".</p>
    <p>States which potentially generate results MAY have "Parameters",
      "ResultSelector" and "ResultPath": Task State, Parallel State, and Map State.</p>
    <p>Pass State MAY have "Parameters" and "ResultPath" to control its output value.</p>

    <h4 id='using-paths'>Using InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath and OutputPath</h4>
    <p>In this discussion, "raw input" means the JSON text that is the input
      to a state. "Result" means the JSON text that a state generates,
      for example from external code invoked by a Task State, the
      combined result of the branches in a Parallel or Map State, or the Value of
      the "Result" field in a Pass State. "Effective input" means the input
      after the application of InputPath and Parameters, "effective result" means the result after processing it with ResultSelector
      and "effective output" means the final state output after processing the result with ResultSelector, ResultPath and OutputPath.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The value of "InputPath" MUST be a Path, which is applied to a
          State’s raw input to select some or all of it; that selection is
          used by the state, for example in passing to Resources
          in Task States and Choices selectors in Choice States.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of "Parameters" MUST be a Payload Template which is a JSON object, whose input is the result
          of applying the InputPath to the raw input. If the "Parameters" field is
          provided, its payload, after the extraction and embedding,
          becomes the effective input.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of "ResultSelector" MUST be a Payload Template, whose
          input is the result, and whose payload replaces and becomes
          the effective result.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of "ResultPath" MUST be a Reference Path, which
          specifies the raw input’s combination with or replacement by the
          state’s result.</p>
        <p>The value of "ResultPath" MUST NOT begin with "$$"; i.e. it may not
          be used to insert content into the Context Object.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of "OutputPath" MUST be a Path, which is applied
          to the state’s output after the application of ResultPath,
          producing the effective output which serves as the raw input for the
          next state.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that JsonPath can yield multiple values when applied to an
      input JSON text. For example, given the text:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{ "a": [1, 2, 3, 4] }</code></pre>
    <p>Then if the JsonPath <code>$.a[0,1]</code> is applied,
      the result will be two JSON texts, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.
      When this happens, to produce the effective input, the interpreter
      gathers the texts into an array, so in this example the state would
      see the input:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">[ 1, 2 ]</code></pre>
    <p>The same rule applies to OutputPath processing; if the OutputPath
      result contains multiple values, the effective output is a JSON array
      containing all of them.</p>
    <p>The "ResultPath" field’s value is a Reference Path that specifies where
      to place the result, relative to the raw input.
      If the raw input has a field at the location addressed by the ResultPath
      value then in the output that field is discarded and overwritten by
      the state's result. Otherwise, a new field is created in the state
      output, with intervening fields constructed as necessary. For example,
      given the raw input:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "master": {
    "detail": [1, 2, 3]
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>If the state's result is the number <code>6</code>, and the
      "ResultPath" is <code>$.master.detail</code>, then in the output the
      <code>detail</code> field would be overwritten:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "master": {
    "detail": 6
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>If instead a "ResultPath" of <code>$.master.result.sum</code> was used
      then the result would be combined with the raw input, producing a chain
      of new fields containing <code>result</code> and <code>sum</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "master": {
    "detail": [1, 2, 3],
    "result": {
      "sum": 6
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>If the value of InputPath is <code>null</code>, that means that
      the raw input is discarded, and the effective input for the state
      is an empty JSON object, <code>{}</code>. Note that having a value
      of <code>null</code> is different from the "InputPath" field being
      absent.</p>
    <p>If the value of ResultPath is <code>null</code>, that means that
      the state’s result is discarded and its raw input
      becomes its result.</p>
    <p>If the value of OutputPath is <code>null</code>, that means the input
      and result are discarded, and the effective output from the state is
      an empty JSON object, <code>{}</code>.</p>
    <h4 id='filter-defaults'>Defaults</h4>
    <p>Each of InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath, and OutputPath are optional.
      The default value of InputPath is "$", so by
      default the effective input is just the raw input.
      The default value of ResultPath is "$", so by default a state’s
      result overwrites and replaces the input.
      The default value of OutputPath is "$", so by default a state’s
      effective output is the result of processing ResultPath.</p>
    <p>Parameters and ResultSelector have no default value. If absent, they have no effect on
      their input.</p>
    <p>Therefore, if none of InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath, or
      OutputPath are supplied, a state consumes the raw input as provided
      and passes its result to the next state.</p>
    <h4 id='filter-example'>Input/Output Processing Examples</h4>
    <p>Consider the example given above, of a Lambda task that sums a pair of
      numbers. As presented, its input is:
      <code class="json">{ "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }</code>
      and its output is:
      <code>7</code>.</p>
    <p>Suppose the input is little more complex:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "title": "Numbers to add",
  "numbers": { "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Then suppose we modify the state definition by adding:</p>
    <pre><code class="nocheck">"InputPath": "$.numbers",
"ResultPath": "$.sum"</code></pre>
    <p>And finally,suppose we simplify Line 4 of the Lambda function to read
      as follows: <code class="nocheck">return JSON.stringify(total)</code>.
      This is probably a better form of the function, which should really
      only care about doing math and not care how its result is labeled.</p>
    <p>In this case, the output would be:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "title": "Numbers to add",
  "numbers": { "val1": 3, "val2": 4 },
  "sum": 7
}</code></pre>
    <p>The interpreter might need to construct multiple levels of JSON object
      to achieve the desired effect. Suppose the input to some Task State
      is:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{ "a": 1 }</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose the output from the Task is "Hi!", and the value of the
      "ResultPath" field is "$.b.greeting". Then the output from
      the state would be:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "a": 1,
  "b": {
    "greeting": "Hi!"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <h4>Runtime Errors</h4>
    <p>Suppose a state’s input
      is the string <code>"foo"</code>, and its "ResultPath" field has the
      value "$.x". Then ResultPath cannot apply and the interpreter fails
      the machine with an Error Name of "States.ResultPathMatchFailure".</p>
    <h3 id='errors'>Errors</h3>
    <p>Any state can encounter runtime errors. Errors can arise because of
      state machine definition issues (e.g. the "ResultPath" problem
      discussed immediately above),
      task failures (e.g. an exception thrown by a Lambda function) or
      because of transient issues, such as network partition events. </p>
    <p>When a state reports an error, the default course of action for the
      interpreter is to fail the whole state machine.</p>

    <h4 id='error-names'>Error representation</h4>
    <p>Errors are identified by case-sensitive strings, called Error
      Names. The States language
      defines a set of built-in strings naming well-known errors, all of
      which begin with the prefix "States."; see
      <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>
    <p>States MAY report errors with other names,
      which MUST NOT begin with the prefix "States.".</p>
    <h4 id='retrying-after-error'>Retrying after error</h4>
    <p>Task States, Parallel States, and Map States MAY
      have a field named "Retry", whose value MUST be an array of objects,
      called Retriers.</p>
    <p>Each Retrier MUST contain a field named "ErrorEquals" whose value
      MUST be a non-empty array of Strings, which match
      <a href='#error-names'>Error Names</a>.</p>
    <p>When a state reports an error, the interpreter scans through the
      Retriers and, when the Error Name appears in the value of
      a Retrier’s "ErrorEquals" field, implements the retry policy described
      in that Retrier.</p>
    <p>An individual Retrier represents a certain number of retries,
      usually at increasing time intervals.</p>
    <p>A Retrier MAY contain a field named "IntervalSeconds", whose value
      MUST be a positive integer, representing the number of seconds before the first
      retry attempt (default value: 1); a field named "MaxAttempts" whose
      value MUST be a non-negative integer, representing the maximum number of
      retry attempts (default: 3);
      and a field named "BackoffRate", a number which is the multiplier
      that increases the retry interval on each attempt (default: 2.0).
      The value of BackoffRate MUST be greater than or equal to 1.0.</p>
    <p>Note that a "MaxAttempts" field whose value is 0 is legal, specifying
      that some error or errors should never be retried. </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a Retrier which will make 2 retry attempts
      after waits of 3 and 4.5 seconds:</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"Retry" : [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 3,
      "MaxAttempts": 2,
      "BackoffRate": 1.5
    }
]</code></pre>
    <p>The reserved name "States.ALL" in a Retrier’s "ErrorEquals" field is a
      wildcard and matches any Error Name. Such a value MUST appear
      alone in the "ErrorEquals" array and MUST appear in the last Retrier in
      the "Retry" array.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a Retrier which will retry any error except
      for "States.Timeout", using the default retry parameters.</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"Retry" : [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
      "MaxAttempts": 0
    },
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ]
    }
]</code></pre>
    <p>If the error recurs more times than allowed for by the "MaxAttempts"
      field, retries cease and normal error handling resumes.</p>

    <h4 id='complex-retries'>Complex retry scenarios</h4>
    <p>A Retrier’s parameters apply across all visits to that
      Retrier in the context of a single state execution. This is best
      illustrated by example; consider the following Task State:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Retry": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorA", "ErrorB" ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 1,
      "BackoffRate": 2,
      "MaxAttempts": 2
    },
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorC" ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 5
    }
  ],
  "Catch": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
      "Next": "Z"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose that this task fails four successive times, throwing Error
      Names "ErrorA", "ErrorB", "ErrorC", and "ErrorB".
      The first two errors match the first retrier and cause waits of one
      and two seconds. The third error matches the second retrier and
      causes a wait of five seconds. The fourth error would match the
      first retrier but its "MaxAttempts" ceiling of two retries has already been
      reached, so that Retrier fails, and execution is redirected to the "Z"
      state via the "Catch" field.</p>
    <p>Note that once the interpreter transitions to another state in any
      way, all the Retrier parameters reset.</p>
    <h4 id='fallback-states'>Fallback states</h4>
    <p>Task States, Parallel States, and Map States MAY have a field named
      "Catch", whose value MUST be an array of objects, called Catchers.</p>
    <p>Each Catcher MUST contain a field named "ErrorEquals", specified exactly
      as with the Retrier "ErrorEquals" field, and a field named "Next"
      whose value MUST be a string exactly matching a
      State Name.</p>
    <p>When a state reports an error and either there is no Retrier, or
      retries have failed to resolve the error, the interpreter scans
      through the Catchers in array order, and when the
      <a href="#error-names">Error Name</a> appears
      in the value of a Catcher’s "ErrorEquals" field, transitions the
      machine to the state named in the value of the "Next" field.</p>
    <p>The reserved name "States.ALL" appearing in a Retrier’s "ErrorEquals"
      field is a wildcard and matches any Error Name. Such a value MUST
      appear alone in the "ErrorEquals" array and MUST appear in the last
      Catcher in the "Catch" array.</p>
    <h4 id='error-output'>Error output</h4>
    <p>When a state reports an error and it matches a Catcher, causing a
      transfer to another state, the state’s result (and thus the input to the
      state identified in the Catcher’s "Next" field) is a JSON object, called
      the Error Output. The Error Output MUST have a string-valued field
      named "Error", containing the Error Name. It SHOULD have a string-valued
      field named "Cause", containing human-readable text about
      the error.</p>
    <p>A Catcher MAY have an "ResultPath" field, which works exactly like
      <a href="#filters">a state’s top-level "ResultPath"</a>, and may be
      used to inject the Error Output into the state’s original
      input to create the input for the Catcher’s "Next" state. The default
      value, if the "ResultPath" field is not provided, is "$", meaning that
      the output consists entirely of the Error Output. </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a Catcher that will transition to the state
      named "RecoveryState" when a Lambda function throws an unhandled Java
      Exception, and otherwise to the "EndMachine" state, which is
      presumably Terminal.</p>
    <p>Also in this example, if the first Catcher matches the Error Name,
      the input to "RecoveryState" will be the original
      state input, with the Error Output as the value of the top-level
      "error-info" field. For any other error, the input to "EndMachine"
      will just be the Error Output.</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"Catch": [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "java.lang.Exception" ],
    "ResultPath": "$.error-info",
    "Next": "RecoveryState"
  },
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
    "Next": "EndMachine"
  }
]</code></pre>
    <p>Each Catcher can specifiy multiple errors to handle.</p>
    <p>When a state has both "Retry" and "Catch" fields, the interpreter
      uses any appropriate Retriers first and only applies the
      a matching Catcher transition if the retry policy fails to resolve the
      error.</p>

    <p>The Pass State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Pass"</code>) by default passes its input
      to its output, performing no work.</p>
    <p>A Pass State MAY have a field named "Result". If present, its value
      is treated as the output of a virtual task, and placed as prescribed
      by the "ResultPath" field, if any, to be passed on to the next
      state. If "Result" is not provided, the output is the input. Thus if
      neither "Result" nor "ResultPath" are provided, the Pass State copies its
      input through to its output.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a Pass

    <h3 id='task-state'>Task State</h3>
    <p>The Task State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Task"</code>) causes the

    <p>A Task State MUST include a "Resource" field, whose value MUST be
      a URI that uniquely identifies the specific task to execute. The
      States language does
      not constrain the URI scheme nor any other part of the URI.</p>
    <p>A Task State MAY include a "Parameters" field, whose value MUST be a
      Payload Template. A Task State MAY include a "ResultSelector" field,
      whose value MUST be a Payload Template.</p>
    <p>Tasks can optionally specify timeouts. Timeouts (the
      "TimeoutSeconds" and "HeartbeatSeconds" fields) are specified in
      seconds and MUST be positive integers.</p>
    <p>Both the total and heartbeat timeouts can be provided indirectly. A
      Task State may have "TimeoutSecondsPath" and "HeartbeatSecondsPath"
      fields which MUST be Reference Paths which, when resolved, MUST select
      fields whose values are positive integers. A Task State MUST NOT include
      both "TimeoutSeconds" and "TimeoutSecondsPath" or both "HeartbeatSeconds"
      and "HeartbeatSecondsPath".</p>
    <p>If provided, the "HeartbeatSeconds" interval
      MUST be smaller than the "TimeoutSeconds" value.</p>
    <p>If not provided, the default value of "TimeoutSeconds" is 60.</p>
    <p>If the state runs longer than the specified timeout, or if more time
      than the specified heartbeat elapses between heartbeats from the task,
      then the interpreter fails the state with
      a <code class="nocheck">States.Timeout</code> Error Name.</p>
    <h3 id='choice-state'>Choice State</h3>
    <p>A Choice State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Choice"</code>) adds branching logic
      to a state machine. </p>
    <p>A Choice State MUST have a "Choices" field whose value is a
      non-empty array. Each element of the array MUST be a JSON object
      and is called a Choice Rule. A Choice Rule may be evaluated to return a
      boolean value. A Choice Rule at the top level, i.e. which is a member of
      the "Choices" array, MUST have a "Next" field, whose value MUST match a
      state name.</p>
    <p>The interpreter attempts pattern-matches against the top-level
      Choice Rules in array order and transitions to the state specified
      in the "Next" field on the first Choice Rule where there is an exact
      match between the input value and a member of the comparison-operator
      array.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a Choice State.</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"DispatchEvent": {
  "Type" : "Choice",
  "Choices": [
    {
        "Not": {
          "Variable": "$.type",
          "StringEquals": "Private"
        },
        "Next": "Public"
    },
    {
      "And": [
	{
	  "Variable": "$.value",
	  "IsPresent": true
	},
	{
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "IsNumeric": true
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "NumericGreaterThanEquals": 20
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "NumericLessThan": 30
        }
      ],
      "Next": "ValueInTwenties"
    },
    {
      "Variable": "$.rating",
      "NumericGreaterThanPath": "$.auditThreshold",
      "Next": "StartAudit"
    }
  ],
  "Default": "RecordEvent"
}

</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, suppose the machine is started with an input value
      of:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "type": "Private",
  "value": 22
}</code></pre>
    <p>Then the
      interpreter will transition to the "ValueInTwenties" state, based
      on the "value" field.</p>
    <p>A Choice Rule MUST be either a Boolean Expression or a
      Data-test Expression.</p>
    <h4 id='boolean-expression'>Boolean expression</h4>
    <p>A Boolean Expression is a JSON object which contains a field named
      "And", "Or", or "Not". If the field name is "And" or "Or", the value
      MUST be an non-empty object array of Choice Rules, which MUST NOT
      contain "Next" fields; the interpreter processes the array
      elements in order, performing the boolean evaluations in the expected
      fashion, ceasing array processing when the boolean value has been
      unambiguously determined.</p>
    <p>The value of a Boolean Expression containing a "Not" field MUST be a
      single Choice Rule, that MUST NOT contain a "Next" field; it returns the
      inverse of the boolean to which the Choice Rule evaluates.</p>
    <h4 id='data-test'>Data-test expression</h4>
    <p>A Data-test Expression Choice Rule is an assertion about a field and its value which
      yields a boolean depending on the data. A Data-test Expression MUST
      contain a field named "Variable" whose value MUST be a Path. </p>
    <p>Each choice rule MUST contain exactly one field containing a
      comparison operator. The following comparison operators are
      supported:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>StringEquals, StringEqualsPath</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>StringLessThan, StringLessThanPath</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>StringGreaterThan, StringGreaterThanPath</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>StringLessThanEquals, StringLessThanEqualsPath</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>StringGreaterThanEquals, StringGreaterThanEqualsPath</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>StringMatches</p>
        <p>Note: The value MUST be a String which
          MAY contain one or more "*" characters.
          The expression yields true if
          the data value selected by the Variable Path matches the
          value, where "*" in the value matches zero or more
          characters. Thus, <code>foo*.log</code>
          matches <code>foo23.log</code>, <code>*.log</code>
          matches <code>zebra.log</code>, and <code>foo*.*</code>
          matches <code>foobar.zebra</code>. No characters other than
          "*" have any special meaning during matching.</p>
        <p>If the character "*" needs to appear as part of the value
          without serving as a wildcard, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.</p>
        <p>If the character "\" needs to appear as part of the value
          without serving as an escape character, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.</p>
        <p>
          The literal string <code>\*</code> represents <code>*</code>.<br/>
          The literal string <code>\\</code> represents <code>\</code>.
        </p>

        <p>In JSON, all backslashes contained in a string literal value must be escaped with another backslash, therefore, the above will equate to:</p>

        <p>
          The escaped string <code>\\*</code> represents <code>*</code>.<br/>
          The escaped string <code>\\\\</code> represents <code>\</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If an open escape backslash <code>\</code> is found in the StringMatches string, the interpreter will throw a runtime error.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IsPresent</p>
        <p>Note: In this case, if the Variable-field Path fails to match
          anything in the input no exception is thrown and the Choice Rule just
          returns false.</p>

      <li>
        <p>IsTimestamp</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For those operators that end with "Path", the value MUST be a
      Path, to be applied to the state’s effective input to yield a value to
      be compared with the value yielded by the Variable path.</p>
    <p>For each operator which compares values, if the values are not both of the
      appropriate type (String, number, boolean,
      or <a href='#timestamps'>Timestamp</a>) the comparison will return false.
      Note that a field which is thought of as a timestamp could be
      matched by a string-typed comparator.</p>
    <p>The various String comparators compare strings character-by-character
      with no special treatments such as case-folding, white-space collapsing,
      or <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode form
        normalization</a>.</p>
    <p>Note that for interoperability, numeric comparisons should not
      be assumed to work with values outside the magnitude or precision
      representable using the IEEE 754-2008 "binary64" data type. In
      particular, integers outside of the range
      [-(2<sup>53</sup>)+1, (2<sup>53</sup>)-1] might fail to compare
      in the expected way.</p>
    <p>A Choice State MAY have a "Default" field, whose value MUST be a string
      whose value MUST match a State name; that state
      will execute if none of the Choice Rules match. The
      interpreter will raise a runtime States.NoChoiceMatched error if a
      Choice State fails to match a Choice Rule and no "Default"
      transition was specified. </p>
    <p>A Choice State MUST NOT be an End state.</p>
    <h3 id='wait-state'>Wait State</h3>
    <p>A Wait State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Wait"</code>) causes
      the interpreter to delay the
      machine from continuing for a specified time. The time can be
      specified as a wait duration, specified in seconds, or an absolute
      expiry time, specified as an ISO-8601 extended offset date-time
      format string.</p>
    <p>For example, the following Wait State introduces a ten-second delay
      into a state machine:</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"wait_ten_seconds" : {
  "Type" : "Wait",
  "Seconds" : 10,
  "Next": "NextState"
}</code></pre>
    <p>This waits until an absolute time:</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"wait_until" : {
  "Type": "Wait",
  "Timestamp": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z",
  "Next": "NextState"
}</code></pre>
    <p>The wait duration does not need to be hardcoded. Here is the same
      example, reworked to look up the timestamp time using a Reference Path
      to the data, which might look like
      <code class="json">{ "expirydate": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z" }</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="member">"wait_until" : {
    "Type": "Wait",
    "TimestampPath": "$.expirydate",
    "Next": "NextState"
}</code></pre>
    <p>A Wait State MUST contain exactly one of "Seconds", "SecondsPath",
      "Timestamp", or "TimestampPath".</p>
    <h3 id='succeed-state'>Succeed State</h3>
    <p>The Succeed State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Succeed"</code>)
      either terminates a state machine successfully, ends a branch of a
      Parallel State, or ends an iteration of a Map State. The output of a
      Succeed State is the same as its input, possibly modified by "InputPath"
      and/or "OutputPath".</p>
    <p>The Succeed State is a useful target for Choice-State branches that
      don't do anything except terminate the machine.</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"SuccessState": {
  "Type": "Succeed"
}</code></pre>
    <p>Because Succeed States are terminal states, they have no "Next"
      field.</p>
    <h3 id='fail-state'>Fail State</h3>
    <p>The Fail State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Fail"</code>) terminates
      the machine and marks it as a failure. </p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"FailState": {
          "Type": "Fail",
          "Error": "ErrorA",
          "Cause": "Kaiju attack"
}</code></pre>
    <p>A Fail State MUST have a string field named "Error", used to provide an
      error name that can be used for error handling (Retry/Catch),
      operational, or diagnostic purposes. A Fail State MUST have a string
      field named "Cause", used to provide a human-readable
      message.</p>
    <p>Because Fail States are terminal states, they have no "Next"
      field.</p>
    <h3 id='parallel-state'>Parallel State</h3>
    <p>The Parallel State (identified
      by <code class="nocheck">"Type":"Parallel"</code>) causes
      parallel execution of "branches".</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"LookupCustomerInfo": {
  "Type": "Parallel",
  "Branches": [
    {
      "StartAt": "LookupAddress",
      "States": {
        "LookupAddress": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource":
            "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:AddressFinder",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "StartAt": "LookupPhone",
      "States": {
        "LookupPhone": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource":
            "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:PhoneFinder",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "Next": "NextState"
}</code></pre>
    <p>A Parallel State causes the interpreter to execute each branch
      starting with the state named in its "StartAt" field,
      as concurrently as possible,
      and wait until each branch terminates
      (reaches a terminal state) before processing the Parallel State's
      "Next" field. In the above example, this means the interpreter waits
      for "LookupAddress" and "LookupPhoneNumber" to both finish before
      transitioning to "NextState". </p>
    <p>In the example above, the LookupAddress and LookupPhoneNumber
      branches are executed in parallel. </p>
    <p>A Parallel State MUST contain a field named "Branches" which is an
      array whose elements MUST be objects. Each object MUST contain fields
      named "States" and "StartAt" whose meanings are exactly like those
      in the top level of a State Machine.</p>
    <p>A state in a Parallel State branch "States" field MUST NOT have a
      "Next" field that targets a field outside of that "States" field.
      A state MUST NOT have a "Next" field which matches a state
      name inside a Parallel State branch’s "States" field unless it is also
      inside the same "States" field.</p>
    <p>Put another way, states in a branch’s "States" field can transition
      only to each other, and no state outside of that "States" field can
      transition into it.</p>
    <p>If any branch fails, due to an unhandled error or by
      transitioning to a Fail State, the entire Parallel State is
      considered to have failed and all the branches
      are terminated. If the error is not handled by the Parallel
      State, the interpreter should terminate the machine execution with an
      error.</p>
    <p>Unlike a Fail State, a Succeed State within a Parallel merely terminates
      its own branch. A Succeed State passes its input through as its output,
      possibly modified by "InputPath" and "OutputPath".</p>
    <p>The Parallel State passes its input (potentially as filtered by the
      "InputPath" field) as the input to each branch’s "StartAt"
      state. It generates a result which is an array with one element for each
      branch containing the output from that branch. The elements of the
      output array correspond to the branches in the same order that they
      appear in the "Branches" array. There is no requirement that all
      elements be of the same type.</p>
    <p>The output array can be inserted into the input data using the
      state’s "ResultPath" field in the usual way.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the following Parallel State:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"FunWithMath": {
  "Type": "Parallel",
  "Branches": [
    {
      "StartAt": "Add",
      "States": {
        "Add": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::task:Add",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "StartAt": "Subtract",
      "States": {
        "Subtract": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::task:Subtract",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "Next": "NextState"
}</code></pre>
    <p>If the "FunWithMath" state was given the JSON
      array <code class="nocheck">[3, 2]</code>
      as input, then both the "Add" and "Subtract" states would receive that
      array as input. The output of "Add" would
      be <code class="nocheck">5</code>, that of
      "Subtract" would be <code class="nocheck">1</code>, and the output of the
      Parallel State would be a JSON array:</p>
    <pre><code>[ 5, 1 ]</code></pre>
    <h3 id='map-state'>Map State</h3>
    <p>The Map State (identified by <code class="nocheck">"Type": "Map"</code>)
      causes the interpreter to process all the elements of an array,
      potentially in parallel, with the processing of each element
      independent of the others.
      This document uses the term "iteration" to describe each such
      nested execution.</p>
    <p>The Parallel State applies multiple different
      state-machine branches to the same input, while the Map State applies a
      single state machine to multiple input elements.</p>
    <p>There are several fields which may be used to control the execution. To
      summarize:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The "Iterator" field’s value is an object that defines a state
          machine which will process each element of the array.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The "ItemsPath" field’s value is a Reference Path identifying where in the
          effective input the array field is found.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The "MaxConcurrency" field’s value is an integer that provides an upper
          bound on how many invocations of the Iterator may run in parallel.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Consider the following example input data:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "ship-date": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z",
  "detail": {
    "delivery-partner": "UQS",
    "shipped": [
      { "prod": "R31", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 1344 },
      { "prod": "S39", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 40 },
      { "prod": "R31", "dest-code": 9833, "quantity": 12 },
      { "prod": "R40", "dest-code": 9860, "quantity": 887 },
      { "prod": "R40", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 1220 }
    ]
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose it is desired to apply a single Lambda function,
      "ship-val", to each of the elements of the
      "shipped" array. Here is an example of an appropriate Map
      State.</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "InputPath": "$.detail",
  "ItemsPath": "$.shipped",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "Iterator": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.detail.shipped",
  "End": true
}</code></pre>
    <p>In the example above, the "ship-val" Lambda function
      will be executed once for each element of the "shipped" field.
      The input to one iteration will be:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "prod": "R31",
  "dest-code": 9511,
  "quantity": 1344
}</code></pre>
    <p>Suppose that the "ship-val" function also needs access to the
      shipment’s courier, which would be the same in each iteration.
      The <a href="#parameters">"Parameters"</a> field may be used to
      construct the raw input for each iteration:</p>
    <pre><code class="state">"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "InputPath": "$.detail",
  "ItemsPath": "$.shipped",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "Parameters": {
    "parcel.$": "$$.Map.Item.Value",
    "courier.$": "$.delivery-partner"
  },
  "Iterator": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.detail.shipped",
  "End": true
}</code></pre>
    <p>The "ship-val" Lambda function will be executed once for each element of
      the array selected by "ItemsPath". In the example above, the raw input to
      one iteration, as specified by "Parameters", will be:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "parcel": {
    "prod": "R31",
    "dest-code": 9511,
    "quantity": 1344
   },
   "courier": "UQS"
}</code></pre>
    <p>In the examples above, the ResultPath results in the output being the same as
      the input, with the "detail.shipped" field being overwritten by an array in
      which each element is the output of the "ship-val" Lambda function as
      applied to the corresponding input element.</p>
    <h4 id='map-input-output'>Map State input/output processing</h4>
    <p>The "InputPath" field operates as usual, selecting part of
      the raw input - in the example, the value of the "detail" field -
      to serve as the effective input.</p>
    <p>A Map State MAY have a "ItemsPath" field, whose value MUST be a
      Reference Path. The Reference Path is applied to the effective input
      and MUST identify a field whose value is a JSON array.</p>
    <p>The default value of "ItemsPath" is "$", which is to say the whole
      effective input. So, if a Map State has neither an "InputPath" nor a
      "ItemsPath" field, it is assuming that the raw input to the state will be
      a JSON array.</p>
    <p>The input to each invocation, by default, is a single element of the
      array field identified by the "ItemsPath" value, but may be
      overridden using the <a href="#parameters">"Parameters"</a> field.</p>
    <p>In each iteration, within the Map State (but not child states
      within an Iterator field), the Context Object will have an object field
      named "Map" which contains an object field named "Item" which
      in turn contains an integer field named "Index" whose
      value is the (zero-based) array index being processed in the
      iteration and a field named "Value", whose value is
      the array element being processed.</p>
    <p>A Map State’s result is an array containing one element for each
      element of the ItemsPath input array, in the same order.</p>
    <h4 id='map-concurrency'>Map State concurrency</h4>
    <p>A Map State MAY have a non-negative integer "MaxConcurrency" field.
      Its default value is zero, which places no limit on invocation
      parallelism and requests the interpreter to execute the
      iterations as concurrently as possible.</p>
    <p>If "MaxConcurrency" has a non-zero value, the interpreter will not allow
      the number of concurrent iterations to exceed that value.</p>
    <p>A MaxConcurrency value of 1 is special, having the effect that interpreter
      will invoke the Iterator once for each array element in the order of their
      appearance in the input, and will not start an iteration until
      the previous iteration has completed execution.</p>
    <h4 id='map-iterator'>Map State Iterator definition</h4>
    <p>A Map State MUST contain an object field named "Iterator" which
      MUST contain fields named "States" and "StartAt", whose meanings are
      exactly like those in the top level of a State Machine.</p>
    <p>A state in the "States" field of an "Iterator" field MUST NOT have a
      "Next" field that targets a field outside of that "States" field.
      A state MUST NOT have a "Next" field which matches a state
      name inside an "Iterator" field’s "States" field unless it is also
      inside the same "States" field.</p>
    <p>Put another way, states in an Iterator’s "States" field can transition
      only to each other, and no state outside of that "States" field can
      transition into it.</p>
    <p>If any iteration fails, due to an unhandled error or by
      transitioning to a Fail state, the entire Map State is
      considered to have failed and all the iterations
      are terminated. If the error is not handled by the Map
      State, the interpreter should terminate the machine execution with an
      error.</p>
    <p>Unlike a Fail State, a Succeed State within a Map merely terminates its
      own iteration. A Succeed State passes its input through as its output,
      possibly modified by "InputPath" and "OutputPath".</p>

    <h3 id='appendix-b'>Appendix B: List of Intrinsic Functions</h3>
    <h4>States.Format</h4>
    <p>This Intrinsic Function takes one or more arguments. The Value of the first MUST be a
      string, which MAY include zero or more instances of the character
      sequence <code>{}</code>. There MUST be as many remaining arguments in
      the Intrinsic Function as there are occurrences of <code>{}</code>. The
      interpreter returns the first-argument string with each <code>{}</code>
      replaced by the Value of the positionally-corresponding argument in the
      Intrinsic Function.</p>
    <p>If necessary, the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> characters can be
      escaped respectively as <code>\\{</code>
      and <code>\\}</code>.</p>
    <p>If the argument is a Path, applying it to the input MUST yield a
      value that is a string, a boolean, a number,
      or <code>null</code>. In each case, the Value is the natural string
      representation; string values are not accompanied by
      enclosing <code>&quot;</code> characters. The Value MUST NOT
      be a JSON array or object.</p>

    <p>For example, given the following Payload Template: </p>
      <pre><code class="json">{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.Format('Your name is {}, we are in the year {}', $.name, 2020)"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "name": "Foo",
  "zebra": "stripe"
}</code></pre>

    <p>After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "foo": "Your name is Foo, we are in the year 2020"
}</code></pre>

    <h4>States.StringToJson</h4>
    <p>This Intrinsic Function takes a single argument whose Value MUST be a
      string.
      The interpreter applies a JSON parser to the Value and
      returns its parsed JSON form.</p>
    <p>For example, given the following Payload Template: </p>
      <pre><code class="json">{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.StringToJson($.someString)"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "someString": "{\"number\": 20}",
  "zebra": "stripe"
}</code></pre>

    <p>After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "foo": {
    "number": 20
  }
}</code></pre>
    <h4>States.JsonToString</h4>
    <p>This Intrinsic Function takes a single argument which MUST be a Path.
      The interpreter returns a string which is a JSON text representing the
      data identified by the Path.</p>
      <p>For example, given the following Payload Template: </p>
      <pre><code class="json">{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.JsonToString($.someJson)"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "someJson": {
    "name": "Foo",
    "year": 2020
  },
  "zebra": "stripe"
}</code></pre>

    <p>After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "foo": "{\"name\":\"Foo\",\"year\":2020}"
}</code></pre>

    <h4>States.Array</h4>
    <p>This Intrinsic Function takes zero or more arguments. The interpreter returns a
      JSON array containing the Values of the arguments, in the order
      provided.</p>
      <p>For example, given the following Payload Template: </p>
      <pre><code class="json">{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.Array('Foo', 2020, $.someJson, null)"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "someJson": {
    "random": "abcdefg"
  },
  "zebra": "stripe"
}</code></pre>

    <p>After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes: </p>
    <pre><code class="json">{
  "foo": [
    "Foo",
    2020,
    {
      "random": "abcdefg"
    },
    null
  ]
}</code></pre>
