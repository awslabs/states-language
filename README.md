# states-language

This repository holds the source code of the Amazon States Language specification, published at https://states-language.net/spec.html

In this particular case, the source code is the target; the specification is authored in HTML. There is a utility that inserts the
leading Table of contents, which we may post after some cleanup.

This repository exists so that we can document errors in the specification and track bug-fixes, clarifications, and
eventually additions to the States Language in a
transparent fashion. We have observed at least two independent implementations of the States Language outside Amazon, which is
allowed by the license in the specification; those implementors deserve a good way to file bugs and track changes.

Pull requests are welcome; this is a living document.  If your pull request is a clarification or correction, there’s a chance
we’ll just take it.  If it substantially changes the meaning or enlarges the scope of the language, we’ll treat it as a feature request.
