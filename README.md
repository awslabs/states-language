# states-language

This repository holds the source code of the Amazon States Language specification, published at https://states-language.net/spec.html

In this particular case, the source code is the target; the specification is authored in HTML. There is a utility that inserts the
leading Table of contents, which we may post after some cleanup. Previously we posted the output of that utility, which made this harder to read and post PRs against; as of September 2019, this is the raw as-edited HTNML.

This repository exists so that we can document errors in the specification and track bug-fixes, clarifications, and additions to the States Language in a
transparent fashion. There are independent implementations of the States Language outside Amazon, which is
allowed by the license in the specification; those implementors deserve a good way to file bugs and track changes.

Pull requests are welcome; this is a living document.  If your pull request is a clarification or correction, there’s a chance
we’ll just take it.  If it substantially changes the meaning or enlarges the scope of the language, we’ll treat it as a feature request.
